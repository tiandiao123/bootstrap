This is a project assignment for implementing bootstrap using progamming R. Basically, it uses resample techniques to get approxiamate mean value of every specific feature in the given data set. This project is from my computer science class (causal Inference class) 
Also, I just commented the line-26 which is used to print out the 12-th column of the data set from Jobs-NoMiss-Cont.tab(the reaosn is that if I print 12-th column of the data set, the terminal will have too much items and probabaly you will search for too long to see the coefficients of the linear regression on the terminal! However, if you want to check the entire output, you can just delete # symbol at the line 26!)
